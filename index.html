            <p>Dark Souls games have been known to be some of the hardest games ever made. I can attest to that, as I
                have quit playing the game more than 10 times! It is an action RPG set in an unforgiving world filled
                with tough, challenging enemies and bosses. You are the “Bearer of the Curse” and the player journeys
                through the kingdom of Drangleic. You battle monsters, collect souls, and uncover the mysteries of the
                land. The game is known not only for its punishing difficulty and intricate game design but also its
                deep lore. Although it is really difficult, the reward after you finish the game and discover the lore
                is worth it.</p>

            <p>I'm a big fan of open-world adventure games because you get to fully explore the map and do your own
                thing. Enshrouded is a multiplayer open-world game set in a dark, mysterious world. You can pick from
                different classes like Archer, Magician, Tank, and more! You'll explore hidden secrets, take on tough
                bosses, and survive some pretty harsh environments. The game is all about exploring, crafting, and
                combat, and while it's definitely challenging, it’s also beautifully done!</p>

            <p>I’m a huge fan of farming simulator games and whenever people ask me what my go-to cozy game is, Stardew
                Valley definitely is on the top of my list! It’s a solo or multiplayer farming simulation RPG game where
                you take over your grandfather’s old farm and make it better! You get to grow your own crops, raise
                animals, mine, fish, and forage. Plus, you can befriend the townsfolk and even get married! </p>

            <p>Tears of the Kingdom is an action-adventure game and the highly anticipated sequel to Breath of the Wild.
                You’re back in the world of Hyrule, playing as Link as he embarks on a journey to rescue Princess Zelda.
                New mechanics have been added, such as the ability to manipulate your environment, new abilities,
                and fresh puzzles. Tears of the Kingdom offers an immersive adventure full of action, puzzles, and
                exploration.</p>

            <p>Valheim is an open-world survival multiplayer game set in a procedurally generated word. It is
                Norse-inspired, and the player takes on the role of a Viking warrior. You can also choose which class
                you want, and I’ve played both as a Magician and a Warrior. Valheim is really fun as you also get to do
                some farming, crafting, and gathering resources to defeat powerful enemies. It is extremely challenging,
                and I like playing this game with friends!</p>

            <p>I've always been a huge fan of shooter games, and when I first tried Valorant, the experience was
                amazing. It combines precise gunplay with character skills and abilities, creating a unique gameplay
                experience. In Valorant, players form teams of 5 playing against another team of 5 where strategy, team
                composition, and communication are crucial for winning. The game offers an engaging shooting experience,
                making it more enjoyable playing with friends! Valorant has become my go to shooting game! </p>
